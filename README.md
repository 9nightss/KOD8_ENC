# KOD8_ENC

KOD 8 PRO is a multi-layered obfuscation and encryption engine designed for high-diffusion data protection. Unlike standard single-algorithm ciphers, KOD 8 utilizes a Strategic Chain Architecture, applying exactly eight distinct, reversible transformations based on the detected or specified input type.

More Features

    Strategic Auto-Detection: The engine analyzes input headers and entropy to automatically select the most effective cipher list (Text, Image, Video, Document, Numeric, or Experimental).
    
Uses a base function, works simply as:  

     F(x) = 1(3(9(7(4(2(6(8*x)))))))  
    
    8-Round Chain Logic: Every piece of data passes through exactly 8 operations. Decryption is achieved by running the identical chain in perfect reverse.

    Turkish Alphabet Support: Specialized Vigenere and Atbash operations that respect the unique character set of the Turkish language (ABCÇDEFGĞHİIJKLMNOÖPRSŞTUÜVYZ).

    Zero-Dependency UI: A professional, high-contrast Tkinter interface built entirely on the Python Standard Library.

    Deterministic Security: Features a Fisher-Yates shuffled S-Box and a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) keystream, both seeded by a customizable master key.

Architecture

The system is divided into two primary modules:

    kod8_engine.py: The cryptographic core containing the primitive operations (S-Box, XOR cascades, Columnar transpositions, etc.) and the 6 defined CipherLists.

    kod8_ui.py: The frontend controller providing real-time verification of each encryption layer.

The 6 Cipher Strategies

ID	Name	Targeted Data	Primary Focus
CL1	Plain Text	Human-readable prose	Turkish-aware substitution & linguistic diffusion.
CL2	Image Files	PNG, JPG, WebP	Binary-safe S-Box layers & block shuffling.
CL3	Video Files	MP4, MKV, AVI	Stream-XOR heavy to break long repeating patterns.
CL4	Documents	PDF, DOCX, TXT	Structure-breaking columnar transpositions.
CL5	Numeric/Data	JSON, CSV, Coords	Base-36 transformation to eliminate decimal patterns.
CL6	Experimental	Mixed/Unknown	Maximum obfuscation using all primitive families.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8 or higher.

    No external libraries (like pip install) are required.

Installation

    Save kod8_engine.py and kod8_ui.py in the same directory.

    (Optional) Open kod8_engine.py and modify the KOD8_KEY variable to your own custom 8-digit numeric string.

Usage

Run the UI via your terminal: 
python kod8_ui.py


Tutorial

    Upload: Click "UPLOAD / BROWSE" to load a file, or type directly into the text area.

    Encrypt: Press "ENCRYPT". The UI will visually "check off" each of the 8 layers as they are applied.

    Save: After encryption, you can save the result as a .kod8 file. This file contains a header identifying which cipher_id was used.

    Decrypt: Load a .kod8 file. If the header is missing, the UI will prompt you to select the original strategy used.

Primitive Operations

KOD 8 uses a variety of mathematical and positional primitives:

    Substitution: S-Box (bijective byte mapping), Vigenere (polyalphabetic), Atbash (mirror), and Base-36 digit shifting.

    Transposition: Rail-Fence (zigzag), Columnar (grid-based), Block Shuffle (key-derived chunk reordering), and circular Block Rotation.

    Diffusion: Rolling XOR (CBC-style byte chaining) and Block XOR Cascade (CBC-style block chaining).

    Encoding: Hex and Base64 normalization.

Chain Safety Rules (R1–R6)

To ensure 100% reversibility without data corruption, the engine enforces strict safety rules:

    R4 (Unicode Constraint): unicode_shift never precedes Turkish-alphabet operations to prevent "breaking" the character mapping.

    R6 (Normalization): All text input is normalized to uppercase before the first step to ensure substitution consistency.

    Binary Integrity: Image and Video lists (CL2, CL3) utilize Base64 as the primary entry point to ensure binary payloads remain printable throughout the chain.
